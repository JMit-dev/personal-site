          - name: "SULI Research Intern"
            date: "Jun 2025 - Aug 2025"
            content: |
              - Built a Java 17 / JavaFX client integrating the Bluesky Queue Server into Phoebus, enabling beamline scientists to queue, edit, and monitor experimental plans in real time without leaving the Phoebus environment
              - Designed a high-performance REST service layer with rate limiting, retry logic, and JSON serialization, streaming live console output and status updates to the UI with sub-second latency
              - Implemented a layered architecture (HTTP client, service, controller, view) for maintainability, type safety, and future extensibility
              - Developed modular, responsive FXML-based widgets supporting drag-and-drop queue management, dynamic parameter editing, and resizable layouts
              - Achieved 100% request success rate in benchmark testing with mean response time of 18.6 ms and stable memory usage during extended operation
              - Deployed both as a standalone Phoebus application and as modular plugins for flexible integration across beamline stations
              - Eliminated the need for external tools, reducing operator context switching and streamlining experimental workflows at the National Synchrotron Light Source II
              - Presented project poster to 300+ attendees including researchers, engineers, and fellow interns at Brookhaven National Laboratory's summer intern symposium, highlighting integration benefits for beamline operations

              - Designed and implemented a custom interpreter for the Deposition Laboratory's control system, enabling EPICS-compatible scripting to streamline experiment automation and device communication
              - Developed Python and C++ bindings for interfacing with EPICS IOCs (Input/Output Controllers), enhancing system flexibility and reducing maintenance overhead
              - Engineered a custom GUI (Qt-based) for chamber status monitoring and user control, improving accessibility for researchers
              - Developed remote script execution using Bluesky QueueServer, allowing researchers to submit and execute experiment scripts remotely with asynchronous job scheduling and real-time status tracking
              - Presented research findings at an in-house BNL research conference
